		</div>
        <p>Our goal has always been to enhance our corporate value, maintain our sustainable long-term development and generate greater returns for our shareholders. In order to better achieve the above objectives, we have established good corporate governance practices following the principles of integrity, transparency, openness and efficiency, and have implemented sound governance structure and measures. We have established and improved various policies, internal controls and other management mechanisms and procedure for the key participants involved in good corporate governance, including shareholders, board of directors and its committees, management and staff, internal auditors, external auditors and other stakeholders (including our customers, local communities, industry peers, regulatory authorities, etc.).
</p>
        <p>In addition, as a company listed in both Hong Kong and New York, we also set forth in this report a summary of the significant differences between the corporate governance practices of the Company and the corporate governance practices required to be followed by U.S. companies under the NYSE's listing standards.</p>

                <p>We require our Board, the Board committees and other internal organs to strictly comply with their internal procedures in accordance with the principles of the CP.

                    <li>Each director discloses to the Company at the time of his appointment and then annually for any change of, his position holding in any public companies or organizations and other significant commitments.</li>
                    <li>China Mobile publishes a Sustainability Report along with its annual report for twelve consecutive years, reporting its performance on ESG issues, which, in many respects, exceed the terms of the ESG Reporting Guide set out in Appendix 27 to the Listing Rules.</li>

                <p>The Remuneration Committee is responsible for determining the remuneration packages of all executive directors and senior management. The remuneration package of our executive directors consists of a basic salary, a performance-linked annual bonus and a term incentive. The remuneration of independent non-executive directors is determined in part by reference to their experience, the prevailing market conditions and their workload as independent non-executive directors and members of the board committees of the Company. Please refer to note 10 to the consolidated financial statements on page 110 of this annual report for directors' and senior management's remuneration in 2018.</p> 
                
                <p>The Board has adopted a Director Nomination Policy. The Nomination Committee and/or the Board should, upon receipt of the proposal on appointment of new director and the biographical information (or relevant details) of the candidate, evaluate such candidate based on the criteria as set out above to determine whether such candidate is qualified for directorship. The Nomination Committee should then recommend to the Board to appoint the appropriate candidate for directorship, as applicable. In evaluating and selecting any candidate for directorship, the following criteria should be taken into account:</p>
                <p><ul>
                <li>Character and integrity;</li>
                <li>Qualifications including professional qualifications, skills, knowledge and experience that are relevant to the Company's business and corporate strategy, and consideration on diversity under the Board Diversity Policy;</li>
                <li>Requirement for the Board to have independent directors in accordance with the Hong Kong Listing Rules and whether the candidate would be considered independent with reference to the independence guidelines set out in the Listing Rules;</li>
                <li>Any potential contributions the candidate can bring to the Board in terms of qualifications, skills, experience, independence and gender diversity;</li>
                <li>Willingness and ability to devote adequate time to discharge duties as a member of the Board and/or Board committee(s) of the Company; and</li>
                <li>Such other perspectives that are appropriate to the Company's business and succession plan and where applicable, may be adopted and/or amended by the Board and/or the Nomination Committee from time to time for nomination of directors and succession planning.</li>
                </ul></p> 
                
                <p>All newly-appointed directors receive a comprehensive induction of directors' duties to make sure that they have a proper understanding of the operations and business of the Company, and that they are fully aware of their responsibilities as a director, the listing rules of the stock exchanges on which the Company is listed, applicable laws and regulations, and the operation and governance policies of the Company. All newly-appointed directors are subject to re-election by shareholders at the first AGM after their appointment. Every director is subject to retirement by rotation and needs to stand for re-election at least once every three years.</p> 
                
                <p>The nomination and appointment of Mr. YANG Jie in 2019 and Dr. YANG Qiang in 2018 were conducted in accordance with the relevant policy. As proposed by the Board, Mr. YANG Jie will receive an annual director's fee of HK$180,000 as approved by the shareholders of the Company. Dr. Yang Qiang will receive an annual director's fee of HK$180,000 as approved by the shareholders of the Company and an annual fee of HK$150,000 as a member of the Audit Committee of the Company. The aforesaid fees are payable on a time pro-rata basis for any non-full year's service. The remuneration of Mr. YANG Jie and Dr. YANG Qiang has been determined by the Board with reference to his duties, responsibilities, experience, prevailing market conditions and so forth. Mr. YANG Jie and Dr. YANG Qiang have voluntarily waived the above-mentioned fees. The Company believes that Dr. Yang's waiver of the fees would not affect his independence as an Independent Non-Executive Director of the Company.</p>
                
                <p>In addition, based on the work arrangements of the Board committees, after review and approval by the Board, Mr. Stephen YIU Kin Wah has been appointed as the Chairman of the Audit Committee, a member of the Nomination Committee and a member of the Remuneration Committee of the Company, with effect from 17 May 2018.

                <p>The task of the Company's management is to implement the strategy and direction as determined by the Board, and to take care of day-to-day operations and functions of the Company. The division of responsibilities among our Chief Executive Officer and other members of the senior management is set out in the biographies of directors and senior management on pages 8 to 11 of this annual report and on the Company's website.</p>
                
                <p>Our management is required to adhere to certain business principles and ethics while performing management duties. For the purpose of promoting honest and ethical conducts and deterring wrongdoings, the Company, in 2004, adopted a code of ethics, which is applicable to our chief executive officer, chief financial officer, deputy chief financial officer, assistant chief financial officer and other designated senior officers of the Group, in accordance with the requirements of the SOX Act. In the event of a breach of the code of ethics, the Company may take appropriate preventive or disciplinary actions after consultation with the Board. The code of ethics has been filed with the U.S. SEC as an exhibit to our annual report on Form 20-F for the financial year ended 31 December 2003, which may also be viewed and downloaded from our website.</p>
                
                <p>The Company established an on-going disclosure control procedure to formulate potential insider dealings. Our CEO and CFO have a personal obligation to maintain the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and internal controls over financial reporting, and to report to the Audit Committee and the external auditor any significant changes, deficiencies and material weaknesses in, and fraud related to, such controls. Besides, the Company provides directors' monthly reports to board members giving the latest development of the Company to enable them to discharge their duties.</p>
                
                <p>To continuously improve corporate governance, we further optimized our management system and improved our business processes, thereby establishing a stringent internal control system and comprehensively preventing risks. We have formulated the Anti-Bribery Guidance for employees to learn more about business bribery and how to identify and deal with it. In 2018, focusing on key areas of business operations, we continued to improve our "Safeguarding Compliance" management mechanism by integrating it into our businesses such as procurement bidding, construction, employment, conflict minerals supply chain, export control, cyber security and market competition. We also organized trainings on compliance risk prevention within the Group, which have covered 78% of all of our staff. With respect to anti-corruption, we continued to improve our 4-in-1 anti-corruption system combining education, prevention, punishment and accountability. We carried out in-depth investigations at the grassroots units and included the "micro-corruption" behaviors that infringe the interests of customers and employees into our internal supervision and examination priorities. Meanwhile, we further strengthened our internal audit by demanding rectification of all issues found in the audit process and holding the relevant personnel accountable for major cases of violation and loss discovered during audits. We conducted anti-corruption trainings and education for employees, which have also been expanded to our suppliers by having them sign a clean commitment agreement. In 2018, we continued to carry out anti-corruption education monthly activities, organized a total of 3,717 educational activities covering more than 90% employees. During the year, the Company received a total of 1,263 complaints from the petition, and the settlement rate was 85%.</p>
                
                <p>We revised and improved our decision-making policies and implementation method, refined our major issue catalogue and criteria to prevent risks in decision-making. We strengthened the inspection mechanism, especially on key areas such as procurement biddings to look for loopholes in our management system and resolve them. Within the Group, we urge for honest operation, healthy development, good performance and shareholders' interests protection.</p>
                
                <p>For whistle blowing, the Company has set an e-mail account (jubao@chinamobile.com), CEO mailbox, a telephone hotline (010-52616186), fax and other channels to encourage employees and the public to raise concerns about misconducts, malpractices or irregularities in any matters related to the Company.

            </div>
            <div class="a">
                <p>IA Dept. conducts independent and objective confirmation and provides consulting services in respect of the appropriateness, compliance and effectiveness of the Company's business activities, internal controls and risk management by applying systematic and standardized auditing procedures and methods. The IA Dept. also assists the Company in improving the effectiveness of corporate governance, risk management and control process, with an aim to increasing its corporate value, improving its operations, promoting its sustainable and healthy development as well as contributing to the achievement of its strategic objectives.</p>
                
                <p>The Company and its operating subsidiaries have set up internal audit departments, which independently audit the business units of the Company and its operating subsidiaries. The head of the IA Dept. directly reports, four times a year, to the Audit Committee which, in turn, reports to the Board regularly. The Board and Audit Committee give instructions with respect to internal auditing. The IA Dept. regularly reports to the senior management for auditing resources and authorization as well as deployment of rectification. The IA Dept. has unrestricted access to the relevant businesses, assets, records and personnel in the course of performing their duties.</p>
                
                <p>The IA Dept. establishes an internal audit scope and framework and carries out risk investigations on an annual basis. According to the results of the risk investigations, the IA Dept. formulates an internal audit project rolling plan and an annual audit plan and, together with the Audit Committee and the Board, reviews and approves the annual audit plan and resources allocation. The annual audit plan of the internal audit department covers various areas, namely financial, internal controls, information systems and risk assessment audits. For financial audit, the IA Dept. reviews and assesses the truthfulness, accuracy, compliance and efficiency of the Company's financial activities and financial information as well as the management and utilization of the Company's capital and assets. For internal controls audit, the IA Dept. audits and assesses the effectiveness in the design and implementation of the Company's internal control system. According to the requirements under the Corporate Governance Code of Hong Kong Listing Rules, section 404 of the SOX Act and Mainland China laws and regulations, the IA Dept. organizes and performs audit assessment on the internal control over financial and non-financial reporting of the Group covering all material areas of financial, operation and compliance controls, on an annual basis, to provide assurance for the Company's management in its issuance of the internal control assessment report. The information systems audit focuses on reviewing and assessing the information systems, information technology applications, information security and the related internal controls and procedures. The IA Dept. shall report to the senior management and the Board on an interim and annual basis. At the same time, the IA Dept. carries on special projects and investigations in response to requests from the Company's management or the Audit Committee or if otherwise required. In addition, without prejudice to its independence, if requested by the Company's management and as required by business needs, the IA Dept. provides management advice or consultancy services by making use of audit resources and audit information to facilitate the Company's decision-making and operational management.</p>
                
                <p>The IA Dept. makes improvement recommendations in respect of its findings in the course of the audits and requests the management to undertake and to confirm the implementation plan, the methods and the timing. It regularly monitors the status of the implementation of the recommendations to ensure their completion.</p>
                
                <p>In 2018, to maintain the healthy development of the Company, we established a new internal audit plan clarifying its path of centralization, specialization and informatization forward. We completed the reform of our centralized two-tier audit organization system at the headquarters and affiliated units, which strengthened the independence, intensity and depth of our internal audit. Moreover, we achieved full coverage of audits on our affiliated units, effectively promoting our risk prevention capabilities and management standards.</p>
                
                <p>In 2018, focusing on the "four orientations" of strategies, key issues, risks and problems identified, we further strengthened auditing and supervision on Internet channels, marketing resources, information security, system control, asset management and other areas to support our strategic initiatives and improve our management and risk prevention capabilities. We deepened the application of big data and cloud computing technologies in developing our audit informatization. The application of artificial intelligence technology in auditing also saw breakthroughs in 2018. Thus, the audit efficiency has been significantly improved.</p>
                
                <p>We report regularly to the Board and Audit Committee with respect to the building up of our internal audit organization, its human resources and qualifications, staff training, annual audit plan and budget, and the audit results. In 2018, we focused our audit on the main findings of each audit project and their rectification. We provide specific guidance on audit focus, rectification advice, team building and others to ensure the effectiveness of internal audit functions.</p>
                
                <p>In 2019, the IA Dept. will concentrate on new tasks of strategic transformation, continue to carry out audits adhering to the "four orientations", accelerate the application of artificial intelligence technologies in internal audits and realize the "Remote + Onsite" auditing model, thereby greatly improving our data auditing capacities and auditing efficiency, thoroughly identifying issues and risks, actively plugging loopholes in management, unceasingly perfecting the Company's processes and systems as well as further enhancing the value of audit work.</p>

                <p>Our Audit Committee under the Board is responsible for conducting annual review of the effectiveness of the Group's risk management and internal control systems to reasonably ensure that the Company is operating legally and the assets are safeguarded and to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the financial information that the Company employs in its business or releases to the public. The said systems are designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to meet business targets and to make reasonable but not absolute assurances with respect to material misrepresentations or losses. As of 31 December 2018, our Audit Committee has evaluated the effectiveness of the Group's risk management and internal controls covering all important aspects including financial, operational and compliance, to ensure we provide sufficient resources in accounting, internal audit and financial reporting, staff qualification and experience, staff training courses and related budget. Based on such review, we consider the Group's risk management and internal control systems to be effective and adequate.</p>
                
                <p>The management of the Company reports to Audit Committee annually about the building-up and performance of its risk management and internal controls, including interim and annual evaluation reports, and receives guidance and supervision from Audit Committee. In 2018, the Company has received the management affirmation with respect to the effectiveness of the risk management and internal controls.</p> 
                
                <p>Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal control over financial reporting. We adopted the control criteria framework set out in the Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) (2013). In compliance with the provisions and requirements under section 404 of the SOX Act and the CP issued by HKEX, we refined our routine management mechanism of internal controls, in establishing a stringent internal control system over financial reporting.</p>
                
                <p>We established a hierarchical top-down risk assessment mechanism, relying on the strategic level risk assessment (material risk assessment), the management level risk assessment (major projects risk assessment) and the operational level risk assessment (procedure risk assessment), to assist the management to acknowledge risk information in a timely manner in order to make a reasonable decision. Based on risk assessment, we established a three-tier internal controls of "the top level internal control system, the internal control professional system and the internal control practices guidelines", which brought the control requirements to the whole process of marketing, production and management. Based on our business operation, we focus on high risk and key management areas and perform risk assessment, so as to enforce our internal control requirement into our daily operation. Meanwhile, we assigned specific responsibilities to individuals and input the control requirements in our IT systems to strengthen the internal controls. And through multiple internal and external supervision and inspections, including self-assessment, management evaluation, external audit, etc., we effectively improved the execution efficiency and effectiveness of our internal controls.</p>
                
                <p>Based on the evaluation conducted by the management of the Company, the management believes that, as of 31 December 2018, the Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective which provided reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for reporting purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.</p>
                
                <p>All disclosure of material information relating to the Company is made through the unified leadership and management of the Board, with the Company's management performing its relevant duties.

            </div>
            <div class="a">
                <p>As a foreign private issuer (as defined in Rule 3b-4 under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended), we are permitted to follow home country practices in lieu of some of the corporate governance practices required to be followed by U.S. companies listed on the NYSE. As a result, our corporate governance practices differ in some respects from those required to be followed by U.S. companies listed on the NYSE.</p>
                
                <p>In accordance with the requirements of section 303A.11 of the NYSE Listed Company Manual, a summary of the significant differences between the Company's corporate governance practices and those required to be followed by U.S. companies under the NYSE's listing standards is disclosed as below.</p>
                
                <p>Section 303A.01 of the NYSE Listed Company Manual provides that listed companies must have a majority of independent directors. As a listed company in Hong Kong, the Company is subject to the requirement under the Hong Kong Listing Rules that at least one-third of its board shall be independent non-executive directors as determined under the Hong Kong Listing Rules. The Company has four (4) independent non-executive directors out of a total of seven (7) directors. The Hong Kong Listing Rules set forth standards for establishing independence, which differ from those set forth in the NYSE Listed Company Manual.</p>
                
                <p>Section 303A.03 of the NYSE Listed Company Manual provides that listed companies must schedule regular executive sessions in which non-management directors meet without management participation. According to the Code Provision A.2.7 of the Corporate Governance Code in Appendix 14 of the Hong Kong Listing Rules, the chairman of a listing company in Hong Kong shall hold meetings at least annually with the non-executive directors (including INEDs) without the presence of executive directors. In 2018, our Audit Committee comprising four INEDs met once with our external auditors without any executive directors present.</p>
                
                <p>Section 303A.04 of the NYSE Listed Company Manual provides that the nominating/corporate governance committee of a listed company must have a written charter that addresses the committee's purpose and responsibilities, which include, among others, the development and recommendation of corporate governance guidelines to the listed company's board of directors. Our Board is responsible for performing the corporate governance duties, including developing and reviewing our policies and practices of corporate governance.</p>
                
                <p>Section 303A.07 of the NYSE Listed Company Manual provides that if an audit committee member simultaneously serves on the audit committee of more than three public companies, and the listed company does not limit the number of audit committees on which its audit committee members serve to three or less, then in each case, the board of directors must determine that such simultaneous service would not impair the ability of such member to effectively serve on the listed company's audit committee and disclose such determination. The Company is not required, under the applicable Hong Kong law, to make such determination.</p>
                
                <p>Section 303A.10 of the NYSE Listed Company Manual provides that listed companies must adopt and disclose a code of business conduct and ethics for directors, officers and employees. While the Company is not required, under the Hong Kong Listing Rules, to adopt such similar code, as required under the SOX Act, the Company has adopted a code of ethics that is applicable to the Company's principal executive officer(s), principal financial officer(s), principal accounting officers or persons performing similar functions.</p>
                
                <p>Section 303A.12(a) of the NYSE Listed Company Manual provides that each listed company's chief executive officer must certify to the NYSE each year whether he or she is not aware of any violation by the company of NYSE corporate governance listing standards. The Company's chief executive officer is not required, under the applicable Hong Kong law, to make similar certifications.</p>
