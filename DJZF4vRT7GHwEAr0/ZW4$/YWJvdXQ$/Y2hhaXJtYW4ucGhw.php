               <div class="subTitleBg"><img src="../images/global/subtitleBg.png" alt=""/></div>
               <div class="subTitle"><a href="javascript:void(0);">Operating Results</a></div>
            </div>
            <div class="a">
               <p>As the traditional communications market is becoming almost saturated, the upside of data traffic is rapidly diminishing and it is increasingly difficult for operators to boost operating results by relying on traditional growth drivers alone. The industry saw negative growth overall, and the Company’s revenue and profit were inevitably squeezed.</p>
               <p>In the first half of 2019, we recorded operating revenue of RMB389.4 billion, which represented a decrease of 0.6% compared with the same period last year. Of this, revenue from telecommunications services accounted for RMB351.4 billion, down by 1.3% year-on-year. We posted EBITDA of RMB151.1 billion, up by 3.6% compared with the first half of 2018. This represents an EBITDA margin of 38.8%, or an increase of 1.6 percentage points year-on-year. Profit attributable to equity shareholders reached RMB56.1 billion or RMB2.74 per share. Despite a year-on-year decline of 14.6%, our profitability still remained at a leading level among top-tier global telecommunications operators. Our capital expenditure was RMB85.2 billion, and we maintained a healthy level of free cash flow at RMB41.0 billion.</p>
               <p>We recorded a net addition of 9.98 million mobile customers, bringing our total to 935 million. Of these, the total number of 4G customers reached 734 million, with a net addition of 21.13 million customers during the first half of 2019. In the wireline broadband market, with a net addition of 18.20 million customers, the total number of customers has reached 175 million. We added 142 million net new Internet of Things (IoT) smart connections, driving the total number of connections to 693 million. The MIGU products saw a rapid uptick in monthly active users. Our household and IoT customers continued  to deliver robust growth.</p>
               <p>Our efforts to optimise revenue structure and inject new momentum into the growth of our revenue streams have paid off, with the household and corporate businesses both maintaining double-digit revenue gain and contributing a bigger portion to our total revenue. Of which, revenue from Mobaihe amounted to RMB6.2 billion (up by 59.7% year-on-year) while that of DICT (data, information and communications technology) reached RMB13.6 billion (up by 47.3% year-on-year). Meanwhile, revenue from IoT stood at RMB5.2 billion (up by 43.8% year-on-year).</p>
               <p>In accordance with the guidance provided earlier this year, the dividend payout ratio for the first half of 2019 was 49%, equivalent to an interim dividend of HK$1.527 per share. The Company attaches great importance to shareholder returns, and will strive to maintain a stable dividend per share for the full year, after giving due consideration to its performance in 2019.</p>
               <p>The Board believes that our industry-leading profitability and ability to generate a healthy cash flow will provide sufficient support for our future development and generate good returns for our shareholders.</p>

               <div class="subTitle"><a href="javascript:void(0);">Advancing Our Business Transformation and Upgrade</a></div>
            </div>
            <div class="a">
            	<p>In the first half of 2019, we were able to get to grips with the new market trends and advance our business transformation and upgrade. This is yielding positive changes to our business development through the three strategies of convergence, integration and digitisation.</p>
            <div class="subSubTitle">Convergence</div>
      			<p>Maintaining a clear focus on satisfying customer demand, we made efforts to increase convergence in our products, sales efforts and operations to expand our market.</p>
             	<p>With regard to enriching our product portfolio, we collaborated with a number of well-known Internet companies to capitalise on the opportunities presented by large volumes of data traffic. We developed products combining “traffic, content and applications” to boost data traffic growth. In the first half of the year, our 4G DOU (the average handset data traffic per user per month) increased by 132.5% year-on-year to 7.1 GB. In the household and corporate markets, we have striven to provide one-stop smart family and smart corporate services to meet customers’ divergent application needs. In the first half of 2019, we also recorded a net addition of 14.33 million customers for our digital set-top box Mobaihe, which represented a penetration rate of 68.7% in the household market, with ICT (information and communications technology) revenue increasing by 149.8% year-on-year.</p>
                <p>To better coordinate our sales forces, we leveraged the cross-selling potential in the personal mobile, household and corporate markets. We further consolidated our core businesses while exploiting synergies between the household and personal mobile, as well as the corporate and consumer markets. We launched integrated marketing campaigns targeting customers with various parameters including levels of years of usage, bonus points and membership, coupled with rebranding and other precision marketing initiatives, to meet different customers’ needs. In the first half of 2019, our wireline and mobile bundling rate saw an increase of 2.6 percentage points from the end of 2018, while our full business bundling rate rose by 8.6 percentage points from the end of 2018.</p>
                <p>To drive operational convergence, we have accelerated the build-out of our network-wide “Mobile Cloud” to establish high-speed designated Internet connectivity amongst cloud resource pools. This initiative forms the architecture for the cloud network smart connection. We have further released synergies amongst the cloud, the network, ends and edge, launching “Cloud, Network and DICT” smart services to deliver a high-quality, low latency and end-to-end differentiating user experience. In the first half of 2019, the Company launched a project to build a cloud-based network resource pool. The aim of this project is to add 18 network elements that have proven commercialisation potential in the cloud for centralised development.</p>

            <div class="subSubTitle">Integration</div>
            	<p>Through integration, we have unleashed the synergy and value of our business by sharing capabilities, connecting channels and desegregating data.</p>
                <p>Our capability-sharing measures were centred around smart families, the Internet and IoT. They included introducing continuous upgrades and taking a holistic approach to developing our digital household open platform, the centralised certification platform and the OneNET IoT open platform. In the first half of 2019, the digital household open platform managed 100 million gateways. On average, the centralised certification platform was deployed more than 1.09 billion times a day, up by 63% year-on-year. It also allowed access to 81 of the top 200 applications. Meanwhile, the OneNET API (Application Programming Interface) was deployed more than 217 million times a day on average and has become a hub for 124,000 developers.</p>
                <p>To connect the channels, we are establishing a one-stop and all-inclusive channel system that effectively consolidates and streamlines online and offline development, in response to the growth of Internet consumption and new retail demand. In the first half of 2019, we adopted the new retail business model  in 25 of our physical outlets and undertook initiatives to establish retail pilot smart stores. Of our services, 39.4% can now be processed on digital channels. Online monthly sales of the 2I2C Data Package were more than 2.8 times the monthly sales for 2018.</p>
                <p>We have strengthened data integration across the board in order to maximise the value of our resources while enhancing operating efficiency, response speed and service quality. In the first half of 2019, the Company initiated the establishment of a tenancy-based big data platform, which will increase the effectiveness of precision marketing based on user profiling. We have been upgrading to a new-generation CRM (customer relationship management) system and have almost completed the integration and centralisation of service data. By taking these measures, we have further enhanced our integrated service capabilities.</p>

            <div class="subSubTitle">Digitisation</div>
            	<p>We have fully leveraged new technologies to digitise our production chains and operation processes, advancing our smart operation capabilities and enhancing operating efficiency.</p>
                <p>We have continued to improve our smart mid-end platform and strengthened smart applications such as artificial intelligence (AI) and big data to support our capabilities across network, market, services, security and management. During the first half of 2019, we accelerated the process to assimilate SDN (software-defined networking) technology into our transmission and carrier networks, enabling us to introduce new functions such as one-stop self-service account opening and data traffic optimisation on our digital channels, substantially strengthening our competitiveness in the industry. We have also introduced a central management system to optimise our network capabilities. In the main urban areas in 100% of Chinese cities at prefecture level or above, we have implemented the more streamlined process of “management by checklist”. In addition, 100% of NB-IoT (narrow band Internet of Things) base stations have connected to the optimised big data platform. To provide better support across our network, we have begun to centralise the construction of key nodes for our CRM and BOSS (business operations support system). Furthermore, to enable data visualisation of users’ full and personalised life cycles, we have taken forward the construction of a central operating platform using big data and AI technology. This improvement will enable us to enhance the digital management of our sales and service efforts. We also launched a unified AI research and development platform and the Big Cloud 5.0 product portfolio to support digitisation and cloud-enabled transformation. This technology has been deployed in a number  of internal AI applications, and has yielded tangible results.</p>

               <div class="subTitle"><a href="javascript:void(0);">Deepening Reforms and Fostering Innovation</a></div>
            </div>
            <div class="a">
				<p>We continued to deepen reforms and foster innovation. Leveraging our strong capabilities, active collaborations and buoyant vitalities, we have accelerated the build-out of a synergetic and efficient operating system across the organisation.</p>
                <p>We have further optimised our operation system toward better strategic planning, resources consolidation, coordination and management, while also driving proactivity. We have completed the organisational restructuring of our corporate, cloud, household and international businesses and formed the corporate business unit based on our corporate business subsidiaries. Additionally, we have established a cloud centre at our Suzhou research and development (R&D) centre and a smart family operation hub at our Hangzhou R&D centre. We have also set up our international business unit at our Headquarters. With these structures in place, we have expedited the development of our core competency in cloud services and household business. These changes have enabled us to better coordinate our corporate and international business for future expansion. Our structure equips Headquarters to command, the regions to compete and the specialised businesses to grow, linking a synergetic dynamic between fundamental factors and capabilities and infusing the Company with growth momentum.</p>
                <p>We have further enhanced our connectivity through initiatives including the coordinated development of 4G and 5G. The total number of 4G base stations  in the first half of  2019 was 2.71 million including  a net addition of 300,000, providing robust support for the development of large volumes of data traffic business. We further enriched transmission pipeline resources by adding 13.4 Tbps bandwidth to international transmission and dedicated corporate lines. We continued to build out our capabilities in integrated service access and optimise our “micro-grid layout”. Boosted by our ongoing work to lay international submarine cables, cross-border terrestrial cables and PoPs (points of present), we have significantly enhanced our network capabilities. This is central to the progressive creation of our international network comprising our Information Highways (connectivity resources), Information Stations (PoPs) and Information Islands (data centres).</p>
                <p>Open collaboration with other industry participants has yielded positive results. On aspects such as customer touchpoints and content-based customer benefits, smart families, 5G, AI, vertical industry chains and Internet finance, the Company has collaborated with a number of well-known Internet businesses and other enterprises to fully leverage the complementary strengths of all the partners to develop the digital services market. In order to achieve synergy across industries, we have actively secured scarce external resources for long-term and mutually beneficial collaboration through diverse methods of capital investment and capital cooperation. Furthermore, we have made good progress in building a “5G+” ecosystem by developing new mechanisms for cooperation with a number of parties including local government, upstream and downstream industry players, innovative technology companies, higher education institutions and research institutions. We have achieved technological maturity with the frequency of 2.6 GHz for 5G basically comparable to that of 3.5 GHz. At the same time, we have steadily proceeded with the innovative convergence of 5G and a plethora of key vertical industries, including 5G+ smart agriculture, industry, transport, healthcare, city administration, finance and education.</p>
                <p>We have continued to drive reforms on operating systems and management mechanisms. Benchmarking global leaders, we have formulated an overall strategy to develop the Company into a first-class international model corporation. We have set clear goals to lead, succeed and set examples. The Company has furthered the implementation of the “Double-Hundred Action”, an initiative for reforming state-owned enterprises, and is exploring mixed-ownership reforms among subsidiaries. With regard to new operations, we have deepened the implementation of various reforms on key areas including the corporate business, cloud capabilities, smart families and international business, with a view to addressing the changing productivity needs for the 5G era. With regard to new incentives, we have proactively explored systems that benchmark market practice and provided guidance to our technology subsidiaries to help them put in place incentive mechanisms in terms of equities, dividends and project investments, etc.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="a">
				<p>In June 2019, we were granted a 5G commercial licence. Immediately following that, we launched our “5G+” brand. As the telecommunications operator with the largest network and customer base in the world combined with world-leading brand value and market capitalisation, we will accelerate the development of 5G and establish our new “5G+” competitive advantages.</p>
           		<p>To this end, we will implement the following comprehensive “5G+” plans:</p>
           		<p><span class="bold">5G+4G.</span> We will drive 5G and 4G technology and resource-sharing, and nurture synergies between the 5G and 4G network coverage and business operations. We will leverage the 4G base station sites and transmission facilities to build out our 5G network in a cost-effective manner. Our plan for this year is to set up more than 50,000 5G base stations in China and launch 5G commercial services in more than 50 cities. At the same time, we will play a more significant role in the next phase of setting international standards for 5G (Release 16). We will coordinate industry efforts to carry out research on fundamental 5G technology in order to ensure the continued advancement of this technology.</p>
                <p><span class="bold">5G+AICDE.</span> We will assimilate emerging technologies such as AI, IoT, cloud computing, big data and edge computing into 5G in order to combine connectivity with digital services. In addition, we will build out our service capability in areas including industrial IoT designated network slicing, one-stop cloud network convergence, secure and reliable big data services and telecommunications-grade edge computing. Centred around 5G, we will build a ubiquitous digital infrastructure, launch new capabilities and applications, develop new use cases and nurture more new businesses. Our goal is to become a leading new smart city operator.</p>
                <p><span class="bold">5G+Ecology.</span> We will establish an all-encompassing 5G open ecology that nurtures a 5G system by connecting partners throughout the information and communications industry chain, key verticals, innovative powers in society, high-performing technology and research institutes, and other telecommunications operators. Through our 5G Innovation Centre, 5G Device Forerunner Initiative, 5G Industry Digital Alliance and 5G Multi-media Innovation Initiative, we will drive, with our partners, the development of 5G devices, the innovation of 5G applications and the creation of 5G premium content. In addition, we will launch the BEST commercial plan, which aims to reinforce the “Basic service”, provide premium “Enabling services” and strengthen “Specialised services” so that we can march into the “Time of 5G” with our partners.</p>
                <p><span class="bold">5G+X.</span> Building on the foundation of the three “5G+” initiatives above, we will develop a “5G+X” strategy, where “X” stands for the wider application of 5G in   a plethora of industry sectors and the mass market. On the one hand, we will launch innovative and integrated 5G applications to promote digitisation across sectors such as agriculture, industry, transport, healthcare, city administration, finance and education. On the other hand, for general customers, we will launch 5G ultra high definition videos, games and ring videos to satisfy customers’ appetite for a better digital life. We have accumulated more than 60 use cases of 5G across verticals, such as smart power grids, smart factories, smart ports, autonomous driving in certain designated areas, emergency rescue missions, remote medical treatment, smart campuses and high-definition cloud-based games.</p>
                <p>The 4G era has already improved people’s lives, and the 5G era will transform our society, bringing opportunities for development that have never been possible before. 5G will become the foundation for all-encompassing smart connections. In this historic moment, we will strive to maintain our competitive advantage and set the benchmark for the global telecommunications industry. We will continue to enhance the value of China Mobile surrounding “5G+”.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="a">
				<p>We remain committed to a high-quality governance structure, putting in place comprehensive and transparent systems to ensure good corporate governance. Underscoring our commitment to ensuring that the Company complies with the law, we have set up a compliance committee and continued to implement the “Safeguarding Compliance” programme. At the same time, we have further enhanced our risk management and internal control mechanisms to ensure that the Company’s operations are sound and healthy. Our commitment has been widely recognised in the capital market. The regional journal Corporate Governance Asia has named us “The Best of Asia – Asia’s Icon on Corporate Governance”.</p>
                <p>We are proactive about fulfilling our social responsibilities. We have further implemented the national policy on “speed upgrade and tariff reduction” in order to ensure that the general public benefit from the development of digital technology. We are striving to leverage the expanded capabilities and enabling functionalities of 5G to provide innovative solutions to sectors across healthcare, education and environmental protection and satisfy people’s aspiration for a better digital life. Moreover, we remain committed to, and have made favourable progress in, protecting customers’ rights, safeguarding emergency communications, cybersecurity and information security. We have also stepped up our efforts to reduce poverty, support charities, reduce pollution and conserve energy.</p>

            <div class="a">
                <p>The macro-economic environment and the industry landscape are currently undergoing gear-changes in four areas. Overall, the economy is shifting from fast-paced expansion to high-quality growth. Information and communications technology has rapidly developed from being purely an enabling infrastructure to being a core force that is leading wider economic growth. The fundamental telecommunications business is also shifting its dynamics from exploiting business scale to creating value based on scale. Finally, competition in the information and communications market has been changing rapidly. Today, the winning components are found not only in the fundamentals of a business but also in its suite of capabilities.</p>
                <p>Economic and social development has boosted the more immediate demand for 5G, presenting opportunities for the transformation and development of the information and communications industry like never before. Firstly, the deep integration between information technology (including 5G) and the real economy will promote smart connections, cloud-network convergence and other adoption across sectors, unleashing a multiplying positive impact on the economy and infusing it with new momentum. Secondly, 5G will support the collection and real-time analysis of massive amounts of multidimensional social information, promoting the coordinated and effective usage, and fair distribution of resources in a smart society, in turn creating new opportunities for social development. Thirdly, 5G will speed up the transition from people-to-people connections to people-to-machine and the smart connections of everything, giving rise to smart families, autonomous driving, virtual offices and other new industries and new digital experiences. Meanwhile, we are well aware of the increasing complexity and challenges in the external operating environment, including downward pressure from the macro-economy and competition arising from the homogeneous nature of industry operators. At the same time, competition across industries has intensified and evolved into a struggle for ecological resources. As the upside of data traffic rapidly diminishes, the industry is facing more severe challenges. Gear-changing has become the immediate reality, and this is challenging operators to explore new development models and new areas of growth.</p>
                <p>A clear understanding of the trend is the first step to success in this market. We have every confidence in our future development. We will make progress on the basis of stable development, and continue to drive the implementation of our strategy for high-quality development that surrounds our business transformation and upgrade, while giving impetus to reform and innovation. We will build on our strong foundation of economies of scale and the implementation of our convergence, integration and digitisation strategies, placing a special emphasis on value generation. We will build synergetic and efficient operations, strengthen our capabilities, promote collaboration and infuse vitality across the organisation. We will fully implement the “5G+” plan, coordinating this with the “four growth engines”, in order to scale up our connections, strengthen connection applications and provide premium connection services to build a world-class corporation. We will march towards our goal of becoming a major force in building “a cyberpower, a digital China and a smart society”, in addition to creating new value for our shareholders.</p>
                <p>Finally, on behalf of the board, I would like to take this opportunity to express my heartfelt gratitude for the support of our shareholders, customers and the general public, and for the dedication and contribution of our employees.</p>
