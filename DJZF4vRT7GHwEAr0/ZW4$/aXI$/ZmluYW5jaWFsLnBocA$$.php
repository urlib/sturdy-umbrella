			<p>In 2018, the Company further deepened the implementation of the "Big connectivity" strategy and the integrated development of the "four growth engines", enhanced the differentiation of products and services, fully utilized price elasticity and stimulated customer demand. In the face of severe adversities resulting from stiffening market competition, a rapid decline in data value and a significant reduction in revenue subsequent to the cancellation of data "roaming" charges, the Group has made prompt adjustments to its business strategy, proactively responded to market competition, further consolidated its market share and customer base, and improved the network and service quality. Following its endeavours to increase revenue and reduce costs, the Group's annual results achieved steady growth.
</p>
            <p>The Company has continued to actively promote its low-cost, high-efficiency operation model, conducted resources utilization evaluation in key areas, and optimized its strategies, budget and performance-based salary management. The Group's operational efficiency has remained favorable, thereby maintaining its profitability at the international first-class operators' level and continuously creating value for shareholders.</p>

					<p>In 2015, CMC transferred its existing telecommunications towers and related assets to China Tower on an arm's length basis at a final consideration of RMB102.736 billion. Pursuant to the transaction agreement, China Tower has issued 45.151 billion consideration shares to CMC at an issue price of RMB1 per share, and a cash consideration of RMB57.585 billion shall also be payable to CMC. Of the cash consideration, the first RMB5 billion was paid on 25 February 2016, while the remaining RMB52.585 billion will be paid before 31 December 2017 with an interest rate of 3.92% per annum to be charged. The transaction generated a one-off gain of RMB10.096 billion. China Tower's centralized construction and operation of telecommunications towers resources would enable the Group to obtain more network infrastructure resources through the co-construction and sharing, and to save its capital expenditure. In addition, as one of the major shareholders of China Tower, the Group expects to benefit from China Tower's future earnings and value enhancement. </p>

				<sup>1</sup> In accordance with requirements of reducing the proportion of labor sourced by third parties that provide services to the Group ("outsourcing labor") among total labor under "Amendment to Labor Contract Law of the PRC" and its associated rules and regulations, the Group has made adjustment on the structure of employees and outsourcing labor. Such adjustment leads to the significantly increase in number of employees and the significantly decrease in number of outsourcing labor in 2015. In order to reasonably reflect the composition and fluctuation of employee benefit and related expenses, the Group presents employee benefit and related expenses by combining personnel expenses and labor service expenses, the latter of which was presented under other operating expenses prior to 2015. The comparative figures have been presented on the same basis.
